# README for data\legal_cases\graph_csv\

The CSV files in this directory are for loading into
an Apache AGE graph with the **agefreighter** library.

These CSV files were created by the data-wrangling process
in these two files in this repo:

- python/dev_wrangle_legal_cases.ps1
- python/dev_wrangle_legal_cases.py
